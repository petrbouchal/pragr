ðŸ“¦ `pragr` aims to provide tools for visualising data about Prague. Currently, it makes Prague raster geodata accessible for use in R via ðŸ“¦ `ggplot2`. 

## Installation
You can install the current version of `pragr` from GitHub with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("petrbouchal/pragr")
```

## What it does

Currently, the ðŸ“¦ enables you to do two things:

1) Add raster tiles from the Prague geoopen data portal to a `ggplot2` object (`prg_tile()`)
2) Add other raster layer to a `ggplot2` object (`prg_basemap()`)

The basic logic of these two functions is that given a simple feature dataset, they provide the tiles or image to create the base map for those coordinates.

It relies on the REST API of ArcGis map/image services that power the geoportal, using documentation for the following operations (endpoints):

- [Image Tile endpoint](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/image-tile.htm)
- [Export Image endoint](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/export-image.htm)
- [Export Map (image) endpoint](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/export-map.htm)

The approach draws heavily on code provided by @[yutannihilation](https://github.com/yutannihilation) in his [blog post](https://yutani.rbind.io/post/2018-06-09-plot-osm-tiles/) on using OpenStreetMap tiles in ðŸ“¦ `ggplot2`.

The approach should be generalisable to other ArcGis-driven servers with the same REST API, though the package as it now is assumes a projected CRS measured in meters, specifically the Krovak crs (EPSG 5514).

# Usage

```{r setup}
library(pragr)
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r load-data}
praha1 <- CzechData::load_RUIAN_settlement(prg_kod, "MOMC_P", WGS84 = F) %>% 
  filter(nazev == 'Praha 1')
```

```{r example-tiles}
ggplot() +
  prg_tile(data = praha1, zoom = 10, alpha = .7, buffer = 200,
           tile_service = 'orto') + 
  geom_sf(data = praha1, fill = alpha("red", 0.6), colour = NA) +
  theme_void()
```

```{r example-base}
ggplot() +
  prg_basemap(data = praha1, alpha = .8, buffer = 200,
              image_service = 'archiv', layer = 6) + 
  geom_sf(data = praha1, fill = alpha("red", 0.6), colour = NA) +
  theme_void()
```

# What's in a name?

The name of the package refers to [Karel Prager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_Prager), a renowned Czech modernist architect. Among other things, he designed - and for a long time worked in - the office buildings in which the [Institute for Planning and Development](https://iprpraha.cz), Prague's public urban planning body, is housed today.

The institute's excellent data team develops and maintains the data and software infrastructure for Prague's geographical data on which this package - and much of Prague's planning, government and business - relies.

Prag is of course how the city was once called by its many German-speaking inhabitants.

# Data sources:

Most map/image services are accessible via <http://www.geoportalpraha.cz/cs/clanek/22/mapove-sluzby>

A more technical route to lists of services is via

- <https://mpp.praha.eu/arcgis/rest/services/>
- <https://tiles.arcgis.com/tiles/SBTXIEUGWbqzUecw/arcgis/rest/services>
- <http://mpp.iprpraha.cz/arcgis/rest/services/>

For some of the services, shortcut notation is implemented for use in the tile/basemap functions.
