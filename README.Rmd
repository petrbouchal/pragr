`pragr` aims to provide tools for visualising data about Prague. Currently, it makes Prague raster geodata accessible for use in R via `ggplot2`. 

It also provides a set of utilities and shortcuts to simplify handling data about Prague.

## Installation
You can install the current version of `pragr` from GitHub with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("petrbouchal/pragr")
```

## What it does

Currently, the ðŸ“¦ enables you to do two things:

1. Add raster tiles from the Prague geoopen data portal to a `ggplot2` object (`prg_tile()`)
2. Add other raster layer to a `ggplot2` object (`prg_basemap()`)

The basic logic of the two core functions is that given a simple feature dataset, they provide the tiles or image to create the base map for those coordinates.

It relies on the REST API of ArcGis map/image services that power the geoportal, using documentation for the following operations (endpoints):

- [Image Tile endpoint](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/image-tile.htm)
- [Export Image endoint](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/export-image.htm)
- [Export Map (image) endpoint](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/export-map.htm)

Additionally, the package provides

- quick access to a number of codes that identify Prague in various administrative or statistical registers.
- a function for downloading official Prague admin geodata (admin boundaries etc.)
- square and hex tiles for equal-area plotting
- a grid object suitable for use in the `geofacet::facet_geo()` function.
- basic demographic data about Prague districts

## Credit, inspiration and extensibility

The approach draws heavily on code provided by @[yutannihilation](https://github.com/yutannihilation) in her [blog post](https://yutani.rbind.io/post/2018-06-09-plot-osm-tiles/) on using OpenStreetMap tiles in ðŸ“¦ `ggplot2`.

The approach should be generalisable to other ArcGIS-driven servers with the same REST API, though the package as it now is assumes a projected CRS measured in meters, specifically the Krovak CRS (EPSG 5514).

## Usage

```{r setup}
library(pragr)
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r load-data}
praha1 <- CzechData::load_RUIAN_settlement(prg_kod, "MOMC_P", WGS84 = F) %>% 
  filter(nazev == 'Praha 1')
```

Note that the possible values of the `tile_service` and `image_service` parameters can be found in `prg_endpoints`.

```{r example-tiles}
ggplot() +
  prg_tile(data = praha1, zoom = 10, alpha = 1, buffer = 200,
           tile_service = 'orto') + 
  geom_sf(data = praha1, colour = alpha("red", 0.6), fill = NA, shape = "dotted") +
  theme_void()
```

The `layer` parameter can take values that you can find by inspecting the given image service (see note on sources below).

```{r example-base}
ggplot() +
  prg_basemap(data = praha1, alpha = 1, buffer = 200, width = 1000,
              image_service = 'cisarske_otisky_1840_velke', layer = 1) + 
  geom_sf(data = praha1, colour = alpha("red", 0.6), fill = NA, shape = "dotted") +
  theme_void()
```

## What's in a name?

The name of the package refers to [Karel Prager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_Prager), a renowned Czech modernist architect. Among other things, he designed - and for a long time worked in - the office buildings in which the [Institute for Planning and Development](https://iprpraha.cz), Prague's public urban planning body, is housed today.

The institute's excellent data team develops and maintains the data and software infrastructure for Prague's geographical data on which this package - and much of Prague's planning, government and business - relies.

Prag is of course how the city was once called by its many German-speaking inhabitants.

## Data sources:

Most map/image services are accessible via <http://www.geoportalpraha.cz/cs/clanek/22/mapove-sluzby>

A more technical route to lists of services is via

- <https://tiles.arcgis.com/tiles/SBTXIEUGWbqzUecw/arcgis/rest/services> for all tile services, including the in-preparation Metropolitan Plan
- <http://gs-pub.iprpraha.cz/arcgis/rest/services/> for most tile, image as well as feature servers
- <https://gs.iprpraha.cz/arcgis/rest/services/> for undocumented services, including the Atlas 5000 map collection which contains data from the 2016 ÃšAP (Core Spatial Analytics) report for Prague, in the [`/uap/` collection](https://gs.iprpraha.cz/arcgis/rest/services/uap) The [`/urk/` collection](https://gs.iprpraha.cz/arcgis/rest/services/urk) contains some interesting data (incl. construction limits ([stavebnÃ­ uzÃ¡vÄ›ry](https://gs.iprpraha.cz/arcgis/rest/services/urk/StavebniUzavery/MapServer)) or the spread of the build-up area over time ([vÃ½voj Prahy](https://gs.iprpraha.cz/arcgis/rest/services/urk/vyvoj_prahy/MapServer))).

Many of these services can be used in WMS mode, i.e. as tiles for `leaflet` maps, or as feature layers for webmaps - see the [web article](/articles/web.html) for an example.

There has recently been a migration from the "mpp.*" servers to the "gs[-pub]*" servers; see <http://app.iprpraha.cz/apl/app/service_viewer/> for the translation. Some services still run on <http://mpp.iprpraha.cz/arcgis/rest/services> but presumably these will go away at some point. For now, this is the only place where the full current Spatial plan lives (<http://mpp.iprpraha.cz/arcgis/rest/services/PUP>).

For some of the services, shortcut notation is implemented for use in the tile/basemap functions. See `prg_endpoints`. **Not all endpoint metadata in `prg_endoints` has been updated to reflect the new URLs.**
