`pragr` aims to provide tools for visualising data about Prague.
Currently, it makes Prague raster geodata accessible for use in R via
`ggplot2`.

It also provides a set of utilities and shortcuts to simplify handling
data about Prague.

## Installation

You can install the current version of `pragr` from GitHub with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("petrbouchal/pragr")
```

## What it does

Currently, the ðŸ“¦ enables you to do two things:

1)  Add raster tiles from the Prague geoopen data portal to a `ggplot2`
    object (`prg_tile()`)
2)  Add other raster layer to a `ggplot2` object (`prg_basemap()`)

The basic logic of the two core functions is that given a simple feature
dataset, they provide the tiles or image to create the base map for
those coordinates.

It relies on the REST API of ArcGis map/image services that power the
geoportal, using documentation for the following operations (endpoints):

  - [Image Tile
    endpoint](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/image-tile.htm)
  - [Export Image
    endoint](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/export-image.htm)
  - [Export Map (image)
    endpoint](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/export-map.htm)

Additionally, the package provides

  - quick access to a number of codes that identify Prague in various
    administrative or statistical registers.
  - a function for downloading official Prague admin geodata (admin
    boundaries etc.)
  - square and hex tiles for equal-area plotting
  - a grid object suitable for use in the `geofacet::facet_geo()`
    function.

## Credit, inspiration and extensibility

The approach draws heavily on code provided by
@[yutannihilation](https://github.com/yutannihilation) in his [blog
post](https://yutani.rbind.io/post/2018-06-09-plot-osm-tiles/) on using
OpenStreetMap tiles in ðŸ“¦ `ggplot2`.

The approach should be generalisable to other ArcGIS-driven servers with
the same REST API, though the package as it now is assumes a projected
CRS measured in meters, specifically the Krovak CRS (EPSG 5514).

## Usage

``` r
library(pragr)
library(dplyr)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'dplyr'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     filter, lag
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
library(sf)
#> Linking to GEOS 3.8.1, GDAL 3.1.1, PROJ 6.3.1
library(ggplot2)
```

``` r
praha1 <- CzechData::load_RUIAN_settlement(prg_kod, "MOMC_P", WGS84 = F) %>% 
  filter(nazev == 'Praha 1')
#> âœ“ Data downloaded and unpacked.
```

Note that the possible values of the `tile_service` and `image_service`
parameters can be found in `prg_endpoints`.

``` r
ggplot() +
  prg_tile(data = praha1, zoom = 10, alpha = .7, buffer = 200,
           tile_service = 'orto') + 
  geom_sf(data = praha1, fill = alpha("red", 0.6), colour = NA) +
  theme_void()
```

The `layer` parameter can take values that you can find by inspecting
the given image service (see note on sources below).

``` r
ggplot() +
  prg_basemap(data = praha1, alpha = .8, buffer = 200,
              image_service = 'mapy_archiv', layer = 6) + 
  geom_sf(data = praha1, fill = alpha("red", 0.6), colour = NA) +
  theme_void()
```

## Whatâ€™s in a name?

The name of the package refers to [Karel
Prager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_Prager), a renowned Czech
modernist architect. Among other things, he designed - and for a long
time worked in - the office buildings in which the [Institute for
Planning and Development](https://iprpraha.cz), Pragueâ€™s public urban
planning body, is housed today.

The instituteâ€™s excellent data team develops and maintains the data and
software infrastructure for Pragueâ€™s geographical data on which this
package - and much of Pragueâ€™s planning, government and business -
relies.

Prag is of course how the city was once called by its many
German-speaking inhabitants.

## Data sources:

Most map/image services are accessible via
<http://www.geoportalpraha.cz/cs/clanek/22/mapove-sluzby>

A more technical route to lists of services is via

  - <https://mpp.praha.eu/arcgis/rest/services/>
  - <https://tiles.arcgis.com/tiles/SBTXIEUGWbqzUecw/arcgis/rest/services>
  - <http://mpp.iprpraha.cz/arcgis/rest/services/>

For some of the services, shortcut notation is implemented for use in
the tile/basemap functions.
